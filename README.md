##<font color="darkgreen">Introduction</font> <img src="/img/imgreadme/Screenshot_screen3tokens.png" width="30">

This is a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game made in **<font color="#ffcc00">JavaScript</font>**.
It has three different types of game, person vs person, person vs CPU or CPU vs CPU.
In this game both players will have three tokens, and after having the six in the board, the player has to click on the symbol that wishes to change and move it to the cell that she/he wants.
Due to the Responsive design made by Bootstrap used in both **<font color="orange">HTML5</font>** and **<font color="blue">CSS</font>** files, this game can be used in phones, computers and tablets.

Thanks to this project I was able to understand and learn JS and practice responsive design. I want to improve this tic tac toe in the future using new technologies to improve it (specially the CPU with AI).
